  ## Introduction
   A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper. The wipers combine two mechanical technologies to perform their task: A combination electric motor and worm gear reduction provides power to the wipers. A neat linkage converts the rotational output of the motor into the back-and-forth motion of the wipers.
  
      
      
  ## Research
  The windshield wiper control module drives the wiper motor based on the the current state of the wiper switch, mostly to support the intermittent wipe feature.
      
  ## Features
  
   1.The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the front and rear, although not all cars have wipers on the rear side. 
   2.Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.
      
  ## Swot Analysis
  ### Strength
   1. It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains.
   2. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption. 
   3. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, etc. are equipped with wipers and are very important for a clear vision.
        
  ### Weakness
  1. Rust or corrosion on the ends.
	2. Dirt and dust stuck in the blades.
	3. Cracks and tears on the rubber lining.
	4. Slight separation of the blades from the frame.
        
  ### Opportunities
   1. Using more appropriate rain sensor we can make more precise automatic wiper system.
   2. By adding microcontroller based system we can implement some security features for automobiles.
   3. We can use a capacitor sensor which will enable it work along line of sight.
   4. The speed controlling mechanism which will make it work according to the intensity and speed of water coming on the sensor.
        
  ## Threats
  
   1. Too much ice or snow on your windshield may cause your wipers to get jammed and cause circuit overloading.
   2. Your wipers may also malfunction if components like the control switch, wiper control unit, wiring, or linkage blades fail.

   ## Who
   A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.
        
   ## What
   Vehicles are now available with driver-programmable intelligent windscreen wipers that detect the presence and amount of rain using a rain sensor.
        
   ## Where
   It is located underneath the dashboard, above the brake and accelerator pedal, and is responsible for the complete operation of the windshield wiper system.
        
   ## When
   Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor. Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.
        
   ## How
   Windshield wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of your steering wheel. Simply moving the stalk down will turn your windshield wipers on. Moving the stalk down will turn your you wipers on.
